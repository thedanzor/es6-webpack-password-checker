ES6 / Webpack Example - Password Checker
===================


This is a simple example of building 3rd party tooling or applications to be consumed by others.
We look at some nice practises while also exploring ES6, Webpack and babel.

The tool is designed to be embeddable onto 3rd party websites without causing conflicts or problems.
We do this by ensuring the JS and CSS are both scoped accordingly, additionally the CSS is reset inside of the container of our example.

#What this tool does
Although over-engineered for the practical use it serves, the simple demo will evaluate the password someone is entering and checks to see if it meets web standards to a reasonable degree.

The purpose of building this tool is to help show AN approach to building 3rd party applications that can be embeddable and used across websites.
